        <p>Welcome to the website of VoodooSoft, LLC ("VoodooSoft", "we" or "us"). The following terms and conditions and VoodooSoft’s Privacy Statement, which is incorporated herein by this reference (collectively "Terms"), apply to your use of VoodooShield.com, including any content, downloads, functionality, products and services offered on or through www.voodooshield.com ("Website"). Please read these Terms carefully before you access or otherwise start to use the Website.</p>



        <div>
  <h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>
  <p>VoodooSoft, LLC ("VoodooSoft" or "we", "us" "our" or words of similar import) is the owner and operator of (www.VoodooShield.com (the "VS Website"). VoodooShield™ is our patented computer lock software we designed to ensure that you have a virus-free experience when you access the Internet.</p>

  <h4>WHAT THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT COVERS</h4>
  <p>We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it through our compliance with this Privacy Policy. Our Privacy Policy describes the types of information we may collect from you or that you may provide when you visit the VS Website. It also describes our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting and disclosing that information. This Privacy Policy covers our privacy practices in operating the VS Website, the VS installable desktop software and otherwise communicating with you. It does not apply to third party websites or their privacy practices. We are not responsible for the privacy policies or practices of third parties. By using the VS Website, you consent to the privacy practices described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

  <h4>TYPE OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h4>

  <h5>Personal Information</h5>
  <p>We treat as "personal information" any information that identifies, relates to, describes, or is capable of being associated with, a particular individual, like your name, job title, e-mail address, home or work address, and home or work telephone number. There are a number of ways your personal information may be provided to us, including:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Purchasing VoodooShield™</strong>: When you purchase a VoodooShield™ license, you will be required to provide personal information, including your name, address, email address, and billing-related financial information, such as credit card number, credit card verification code, account number, billing zip code, and other information depending on the type of payment method you select. If we use third party payment services, the personal information you provide as part of the payment process will be provided to such third parties and will be subject to their privacy practices and policies. If we sell VoodooShield™ licenses directly, the personal information you provide as part of the payment process will be provided to us and will be subject to this Privacy Policy.</li>
    <li><strong>Download and Registration Process</strong>: We currently limit the personal information we request from you during the download and registration processes to your email address and password.</li>
    <li><strong>VoodooShield™ Snapshot</strong>: VoodooShield™ uses a proprietary, patented snapshot feature to learn what programs and processes you run on your computer. Each time VoodooShield™ is activated, it takes a snapshot of the processes that are running on your computer at that time. This snapshot is remembered the next time VoodooShield™ is activated to prevent VoodooShield™ from blocking your use of these processes in subsequent internet sessions. This snapshot is also uploaded to a secure VoodooSoft server (or third party host server under contract with VoodooSoft) to create a backup that can be provided to you whenever necessary. The snapshot only contains a list of processes that have run on your computer while VoodooShield™ was in operation mode, and does not contain other private data such as your credit card information, other financial information, browser history, website favorites, passwords, or other data generated by any of your applications.</li>
    <li><strong>VoodooShield Log Application Files</strong>: Information from VoodooShield's log application files is periodically automatically uploaded to our servers to enable us to track any errors that might occur while VoodooShield™ is running, track the frequency of VoodooShield™ activation and deactivation, and identify processes that have been blocked. This information will help us in providing any technical support you may require and will also assist us to improve the VoodooShield™ user experience.</li>
    <li><strong>VoodooShield's Cloud-Based Blacklist Scanning Feature</strong>: VoodooShield's cloud-based blacklist scanning feature blocks executable files that are not already whitelisted (allowed) by VoodooShield™. If VoodooShield™ blocks a file, an optional feature is included in VoodooShield™ to automatically upload the file for scanning by 50 of the leading continuously updated blacklist antivirus solutions. In implementing this feature, VoodooShield™ has disabled the uploading of personally-identifiable non-executable files, and only executable files are uploaded for analysis.</li>
    <li><strong>Technical Support</strong>: If you request technical support, we may ask you for information necessary to provide the requested support, such as your name, address, and information about your computer hardware, software, and the nature of the problem you are experiencing. Additionally, if required to facilitate support, we may with your permission conduct an interactive session in which a VoodooSoft technician remotely assumes control of your computer. No information is retained from such sessions beyond information to substantiate that such session(s) took place. We may retain information concerning technical issues to provide you with continuing support and to improve our products and services.</li>
    <li><strong>Soliciting your Opinion and Feedback</strong>: We may ask you to provide us your opinion and feedback regarding our products and services generally and we will solicit your opinion and feedback when you download a beta version of our software that has been released for testing. In this regard, you may be asked to provide us your e-mail address name, postal address, occupation and the name of your organization, if you have not already done so, as well as the opinions and feedback itself.</li>
  </ul>
